# Homework 3a: Azure Synapse Workspace and Parquet Files Creation

## Objective

In this assignment, we are getting back to our NHTSA data where you will begin working with Azure Synapse Analytics and utilize its SQL Serverless pools powered by a Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) engine. Your task is to prepare your data by converting the NHTSA Complaints File into a `.parquet` format suitable for distributed systems and datasets (sharding). This process simulates the preparation needed to connect to data using Polybase and read directly from the Data Lake. In **Homework 3b**, you will connect to this data as an external table. The main objective of this assignment is to create an **Azure Synapse Workspace** and partition `.parquet` files by manufacturer name.

## Reference Documents and Tools
Navigating the Azure portal and specific interfaces for each service can be a little tricky, especially if you don't have experiences with databases or cloud services. Below are many resources that will help with each activity you will need to perform to complete the assignment. If you don't have experience in these areas, please review these before getting started on the final portion of the assignment. Be sure to read this entire assignment as you will run into issues that are addressed at the bottom.

Ensure all steps are completed accurately and verify that the `.parquet` files are correctly partitioned and accessible from your Synapse Workspace. Reach out to your **LF (Learning Facilitator)** if you have any questions or need further assistance.

## Tasks

---

### 1. Upgrade Your Storage Account

To link your **Synapse Workspace** to a storage account, it may need to be **upgraded to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen 2** if it wasn't set up during the initial deployment. If your storage account is not already upgraded, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to your Storage Account** in the Azure Portal.
2. In the **left-hand menu**, go to **Settings** > **Data Lake Gen2 upgrade**.
3. Click **Review and agree to changes** to proceed with the upgrade.
4. **Validate your account** to check for any features that may not be supported.
5. Once validation is complete, **start the upgrade** process.
6. After the upgrade, confirm that **Hierarchical Namespace** is enabled under **Configuration**.

### 2. Convert the NHTSA TXT File to Parquet Format

Use **Azure Data Factory (ADF) Data Flows** to perform the following steps:

- Hint:
- ![Dataflow](../../images/hw3a/dataflow.png)

1. **Set Up a Data Flow**:
   - Configure the NHTSA TXT file from Homework 1b as the data source.

2. **Configure the Sink**:
   - The output format must be `.parquet`.
   - Linked Service: `Azure Data Lake Storage`.
   - <mark>**IMPORTANT STEP:**</mark> Go to the 'Mapping' section under the sink settings and update the output column names accordingly.
      - Ensure that the column names match those specified in the [Complaints Reference File](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/cmpl/Import_Instructions_Excel_All.pdf)
   
3. **Partition the Parquet Files**:
   - Partition the `.parquet` files by the manufacturer name.
   - Some manufacturer names end with a dot (.), this is not allowed in your storage accounts, use filters to filter them out using filter operator in data flow.
   - Refer to the [Complaints Reference File](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/cmpl/Import_Instructions_Excel_All.pdf) for field details.

### 3. Create Your Synapse Workspace

Set up your **Azure Synapse Workspace** by following these steps:

1. **Create the Synapse Workspace**:
   - Refer to this [tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/get-started-create-workspace) for detailed instructions.
   - **Note**: Do not use the sample data provided in the tutorial.

2. **Link Your Storage Account**:
   - In the Data section of the Synapse Workspace, add your storage account as a linked service if not already connected.
   - Ensure the primary storage account is correctly set up as ADLS Gen 2.

---

### 4. Verify the Created Parquet File

Ensure the `.parquet` files created from the NHTSA data are **accessible in your Synapse Workspace**. This will be essential for the **subsequent homework**.

## Expected Output

> Upon completion, your output should look like the following image:

1. **Storage Container View on Synapse Workspace**:

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you run into issues while completing the assignment, consider these common **troubleshooting steps**:

### 1. **ADLS Gen2 Upgrade Errors**
- **Issue:** Getting an error related to `containerDeleteRetentionPolicy` when validating the upgrade.  
- **Fix:**  
  - Navigate to **Data management** > **Data protection** in your storage account.
  - Disable the **Container delete retention policy** (everything).
  - Save the changes and retry the validation process.

### 2. **Setting Up Filter**
- **Issue:** If the name in **Manufacturer Name** ends with a period (.), it may cause an error.
- **Fix:**  
  - Use a **filter transformation** in Azure Data Factory (ADF) to remove these rows:
    ```
    right({column_name}, 1) != '.'
    # column_name must be edited with the proper column name
    ```
    or
    ```
    !endsWith({column_name}, ".")
    # column_name must be edited with the proper column name
    ```
  - ![Filter](../../images/hw3a/filter.png)

### 3. **Setting Up Derived Columns**
- **Issue:** Parquet files are missing `.parquet` extension in their filenames.
- **Fix:**  
  - Use a **Derived Column** transformation in ADF to append `.parquet` to each filename:
    ```
    concat({column_name}, '.parquet')
    # column_name must be edited with the proper column name
    ```
  - ![Derived](../../images/hw3a/derived.png)

### 4. **Setting Up Partitioning**
- **Issue:** Partitioning based on column data is not working.
- **Fix:**  
  - Set **"Source" to "Single Partition"** in the **Optimize settings**.
  - There are **two partitioning options** for sink in Azure Data Factory:
    - **File Name as Column Data** → **Files** named after the **Manufacturer**. → **This is Correct**
    - **Set Partitioning - Key** → **Folders** named after the **Manufacturer**. → This is Incorrect
  - ![Partitioning](../../images/hw3a/partitioning.png)

### 5. **Synapse Storage Link Issues**
- **Issue:** Parquet files are **not appearing** in **Synapse Analytics**.
- **Fix:**  
  - Ensure your **Storage Account is correctly linked** in **Azure Synapse Analytics**.
  - Navigate to **Data** → **Linked Services** → Click **"+"** → **"Connect to external data"** → Select your **Storage Account**.
